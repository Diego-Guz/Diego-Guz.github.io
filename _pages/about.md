Hello and welcome! I am currently a senior Informatics student at UC Irvine, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction and minoring in Information and Computer Sciences. Alongside my studies, I am actively involved in undergraduate research at the [Social & Technological Action Research (STAR) Lab](https://www.star-uci.org/), advised by [Dr. Jesus Armando Beltran Verdugo](https://sites.google.com/view/armandobeltran/), [Dr. Franceli Cibrian](https://sites.google.com/view/franceli-l-cibrian), and [Dr. Gillian Hayes](https://www.gillianhayes.com/). During the summer of 2024, I was an Undergraduate Research Intern at UC Berkeley's [EPIC Data Lab](https://epic.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Yiming Lin](https://yiminglin18.com/) and [Dr. Aditya Parameswaran](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/). This upcoming fall, I will be starting my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Informatics at Emory University.

Broadly, my current research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and
applied Machine Learning in the domain of Assistive Technology. More specially, I aim to empower individuals with disabilities by developing accessible and interactive technologies that help them overcome physical and cognitive barriers in their daily lives.
