Hello and welcome! I am a senior at UC Irvine majoring in Informatics with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction and a minor in Information and Computer Sciences. Iâ€™m actively involved in undergraduate research at the [Social & Technological Action Research (STAR) Lab](https://www.star-uci.org/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jesus Armando Beltran Verdugo](https://sites.google.com/view/armandobeltran/), [Dr. Franceli Cibrian](https://sites.google.com/view/franceli-l-cibrian), and [Dr. Gillian Hayes](https://www.gillianhayes.com/). 

During the summer of 2024, I worked as an Undergraduate Research Intern at UC Berkeley's [EPIC Data Lab](https://epic.berkeley.edu/) mentored by [Dr. Yiming Lin](https://yiminglin18.com/) and [Dr. Aditya Parameswaran](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/). This upcoming fall, I will begin my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Informatics at Emory University.

My current research interests include Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and
applied Machine Learning in the domain of Assistive Technology. More specifically, I am passionate about creating accessible, interactive systems that support individuals with disabilities in overcoming everyday physical and cognitive challenges.
